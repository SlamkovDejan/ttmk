## Database
### PostgreSQL

The project is divided in five phases, each phase with its own requirements (`phase <i>/README.md`)(mk). The phases are meant to help build the project incrementally.

#### Phases
##### Phase one (`phase 1/`)
- The goal of the first phase is to define the project data requirements and design the database schema (conceptual design) with the help of an ER diagram.
##### Phase two (`phase 2/`)
- The goal of the second phase is to generate a relational schema specific to PostgreSQL from the previously defined ER model and subsequently create the defined tables and fill them with data.
##### Phase three (`phase 3/`)
- The goal of the third phase is to define use cases (and their associated SQL queries) for the database.
##### Phase four (`phase 4/`)
- The goal of the fourth phase is to define "complex" SQL queries over the database.
##### Phase five (`/web/` & `/front-end/`)
- The goal of the fifth phase is to create an application that uses the database and incorporates the use cases and the complex queries from the previous phases.
